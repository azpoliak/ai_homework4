Decision Trees - Report differences in metric for IG vs IG ratio; pruning and not pruning; accuracy, precision, recall
on all data sets

Naive Bayes - report accuracy, precision, recall on all data sets

Neural Network - Report differences in accuracy, precision and recall using default and alternate weight recalls; report
difference w/ momentum

Discuss how the performances of the algorithms compare on each data set. Which is the best for each data set? Which
metrics do you use to determine this and how does the nature of the data set affect your decision?
